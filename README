Hackeriet's doorbot

It's simple: we have an RFID reader hooked up to an Arduino,
to read 125kHz cards.

We have a Raspberry reading the arduino's output on TTL pins,
and we have strike locks hooked up to a circuity board with
relays that are on the pi's gpio pins.

Now we can unlock the door with software. This software.

door.sh      :  door service, waits for cards, opens doors
opendoor.sh  : just open the door already
opendoor     : binary to call opendoor.sh, for setuid
rc.door      : init script

You can set the opendoor binary to be a user's shell, then add ssh keys to that user's
authorized_keys, and open the door with ssh keys.
