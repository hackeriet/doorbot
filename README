Hackeriet's doorbot
===================

System Design Objectives:

tamper and sabotage resist.
cheaply, easily sourced and quickly interchangable parts.
semi-decentralized. network attached.

Raspberry PI's with raspberian + relays + strike locks + rfid readers
(vastly overdimentioned, but practical and economical)

It's simple: we have an RFID reader hooked up to an Arduino,
to read 125kHz cards.

We have a Raspberry reading the arduino's output on TTL pins,
and we have strike locks hooked up to a circuity board with
relays that are on the pi's gpio pins.

Now we can unlock the door with software. This software.

lockservice	: door service, waits for cards, opens doors
open-ze-door	: just open the door already
rc.lockservice  : init script

run "sudo make install" to put things where they belong, usually
/usr/local/bin/ and /etc/init.d/

Run door.sh to serve the door.
Scan the card you wish to add, then
copy the full card number from the console output 
into /home/pi/users/$username

You can set the opendoor binary to be a user's shell, 
then add ssh keys to that user's authorized_keys, 
and open the door with ssh keys.
